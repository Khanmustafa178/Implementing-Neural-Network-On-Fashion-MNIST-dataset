# Implementing-Neural-Network-On-Fashion-MNIST-dataset
In this post, we implemented the neural network for Fashion-MNIST. Through this process, we preprocess the dataset and generate the input pipeline. Then add the layers in sequential model. After that, we defined loss function and optimizers for training.
Thanks to the tensorflow-keras, we can easily train the model and evalute its performance.
